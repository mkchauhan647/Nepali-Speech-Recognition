This is our major project On Nepali Speech Recognition using deep neural networks

Overview: 
  - CNN Layers
  - RNN Layers
  - Bidirectional GRU Layers
  - CTCLoss Function is used to calculate the loss.
  - it's working fine with word error rate of 0.2 - 0.4.
  - Need to do fine tuning , more audio processing, noise cancelation and some reshaping

  - This is hosted locally but I use port forward to host over public internet. So that anyone on the internet can able to access the website and can able totest our Model.
  - This is the link: If anyone interested to check or test please feel free to raise a issues or message me at mkchauhan647@gmail.com and I will start the server so that you can able to access the website
    via internet.
